## Reusing part of the code

You are welcome to use part or all the code for your own projects. But we kindly ask you to follow these rules:

- State somewhere that part of the code uses this project code
- If you bring significant enhancements to the code, share it with us (either via DM or a PR or an issue) and/or the SimRail modding community
- If you directly use the API, don't be reckless in the amount of requests made

Of course, we will not send lawyers to your house if you don't follow these rules, we are all having fun with our favorite train game :)

## Localization

Translations are happening via [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/simrail-community/edr). If you wish to participate, we ask that you first contact [@Tallyrald](https://github.com/Tallyrald) via email or on the [Simrail forums](https://forum.simrail.eu/profile/782-crypter-emerald/).

## Self Hosting

Self hosting documentation is planned. The software needs a few adjustements to make it work easilly, but if you know your way around the code you can already do so! :)
